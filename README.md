# lighttable-dracula-theme
An implementation of Dracula theme (www.draculatheme.com) for LightTable Editor
This is my implementation of Dracula theme. 

To install just go to Settings -> User behaviors and add the following lines:
```
[:app :lt.objs.style/provide-theme "dracula" "/path/to/theme/dracula.css"]
[:editor :lt.objs.style/set-theme "dracula"]
```
You can put the css anywhere and just make the path in the first line use it.

How it looks:
